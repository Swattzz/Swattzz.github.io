	Hi, I am a first-year EE master student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.
</p>
<p>
	I received my bachelor's degree from EE department, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2019. After that, I was admitted to the graduate school of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
</p>
<p>
	I joined Research Center of Intelligent Internet of Things (IIoT) in 2017 and have been supervised by Professor <a href="http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/xtian/"> Xiaohua Tian</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/"> Xinbing Wang</a> since then. My research work in IIoT includes backscatter communication and localization. My research interests are mainly on wireless communication and wireless sensing. Before joing IIoT, I also worked with with Professor <a href="http://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyDetail/30"> Xiaohong Sui</a> and <a href="http://sourcedb.sinano.cas.cn/yw/peo/facultyorstaff/201204/t20120426_3564019.html"> Xiaohua Zhang</a> in the area of biomedical engineering.
</p>
<h2>My Academic Experience</h2>
	<h3>From 2015 to 2017</h3>
	<p>
		I worked with Jingran Zhu and Yiling Wang under the supervision of Prof. Sui in the department of Biomedical Engineering. The research topic is CNT electrodes.
	</p>
	<h3>From 2017 to 2020</h3>
	<p>
		In 2017, I joined IIoT and began to work with Renjie Zhao under the supervision of Prof. Tian. The research topic is OFDMA backscatter.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2018, I collabrated with Xinyu Tong and applied AoA localization technique to backscatter networks.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2019, I came up with an idea and began to build a more practical and large-scale backscatter network with Yuda Feng and Qianru Li. Meanwhile, Professor Tian became my M.S. advisor.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2020, I am still working on wireless communication. My teammates include Ke Li, Mingwei Ouyang, Zitong Wang, Zixuan Zhang and Zhexuan Cai.
