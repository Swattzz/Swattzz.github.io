	Hi, I am a first-year Ph.D. student in EE department, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China.
</p>
<p>
	Here is my e-mail address in SJTU: jsqdzhufengyuan@sjtu.edu.cn
</p>
<p>
	I received my bachelor's degree from EE department, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2019. After that, I was admitted to the graduate school of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
</p>
<p>
	I joined Research Center of Intelligent Internet of Things (IIoT) in 2017 and have been supervised by Professor <a href="http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/xtian/"> Xiaohua Tian</a> since then. My research work in IIoT includes backscatter communication and localization. My research interests are mainly on wireless communication and wireless sensing. 
</p>
<h2>My Academic Experience</h2>
	<h3>From 2015 to 2017</h3>
	<p>
		I worked with Jingran Zhu and Yiling Wang under the supervision of Prof. Sui in the department of Biomedical Engineering. The research topic is CNT electrodes.
	</p>
	<h3>From 2017 to 2022</h3>
	<p>
		In 2017, I joined IIoT and began to work with Renjie Zhao under the supervision of Prof. Tian. The research topic is OFDMA backscatter.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2021, I began my Ph.D. program in EE department, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. Tian.
